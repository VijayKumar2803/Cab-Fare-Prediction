## Overview

In the transportation industry, accurately predicting cab fares is crucial for both service providers and customers. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict cab fares based on various input features. By analyzing historical cab ride data, the model aims to learn patterns and relationships between the input features and the fare amount.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical data of cab rides including features such as pickup and drop-off locations, timestamp, number of passengers, and fare amount. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, where the training set is used to train the machine learning models and the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the trained models.

## Preprocessing

Before training the models, the dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, data type conversion, and outlier removal. Additionally, data cleaning techniques are applied to ensure the quality and consistency of the data.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering plays a crucial role in improving the predictive performance of the models. In this project, various features are derived from the existing dataset such as distance between pickup and drop-off locations, day of the week, and hour of the day. These engineered features provide additional information that can improve the accuracy of the predictions.

## Model Building

Several machine learning algorithms are explored in this project including linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, and gradient boosting regression. Each model is trained using the training dataset and evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE) and R-squared.

## Evaluation

The performance of each model is evaluated using the testing dataset. The evaluation metrics provide insights into the accuracy and generalization ability of the trained models. By comparing the performance of different algorithms, the most suitable model for cab fare prediction is identified.

## Results

The results of the project demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in predicting cab fares. The trained models achieve competitive performance in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization ability. The insights gained from the project can be valuable for both cab service providers and customers in estimating fare amounts for future rides.

## Usage

To use the trained models for cab fare prediction, follow these steps:

1. Load the trained model using the provided scripts or notebooks.
2. Provide input features such as pickup location, drop-off location, number of passengers, and timestamp.
3. Use the loaded model to predict the fare amount for the given input.
